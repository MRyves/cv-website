      <Template title="ABOUT ME">
        I have been working as a backend & frontend developer for around 10
        years. During these years I used a lot(!) of programming languages
        staring from C/C++ and ending at JavaScript. In my last position as a
        frontend-focused dev i grew a strong liking in JavaScript & Typescript.
        I strongly believe that these languages are here to stay and as the
        current development shows they will become more and more relevant for
        backend applications. My personal favourite Frontend-Framework is
        Angular, but React and Vue are ok to ;)
